[00:04.44] When my roommate comes into the room looking for his car keys
[00:08.77] I don't say it yet
[00:12.35] And when he gets me off the couch to check underneath the couch cushions
[00:16.69] I don't say it yet, no
[00:20.88] And then when he says out loud "I wonder where my car keys are"
[00:23.83] I still don't say it (I still don't say it yet)
[00:28.66] But then he asks me "Do you know where my car keys are?"
[00:32.51] I look at him in his face, and I say
[00:36.77] "Have you checked your butthole?"
[00:39.08] Ski-dap, ba-dap, butthole
[00:41.51] I have not seen your keys, but since you're askin' me
[00:44.87] You better check up that butthole
[00:46.30] Of course I'm not serious
[00:47.75] I don't think it's up inside your big brown business
[00:50.44] But a funny thing to say to someone who's lost their shit and is stressed out visibly
[00:54.55] When I see the best man start to sweat
[00:58.77] I don't say it yet (Ski-dap, ba-dap)
[01:02.77] When I see that little ring bearer cunt getting yelled at by his mum
[01:06.44] Oh, I still don't say it
[01:10.48] When I see the groom asking the vicar if they can wait just another fifteen minutes
[01:14.67] I do not say it (Ski-bap, ba-da)
[01:18.48] And when the father of the bride starts organizing an ad-hoc emu bob of the courtyard area
[01:23.63] I want to, but I do not say it
[01:26.53] It's the eleventh hour with three hundred congregates under God's roof
[01:30.28] The vicar approaches the mic, and suddenly, all of the chatter goes mute
[01:34.26] He says that they've misplaced the rings
[01:35.82] Could anyone possibly know where they are?
[01:37.97] I know it's my time, and all heads turn as I stand and say, "Vicar!"
[01:42.92] "Have you checked your butthole?"
[01:44.96] Ski-dap, ba-dap, butthole
[01:47.50] "I have not seen your ring, but have you checked your ring?"
[01:50.77] And by "ring," I mean butthole
[01:52.03] Love is patient; love is kind
[01:53.86] But if you ask me where you can find
[01:55.96] Literally anything you've lost before
[01:57.81] I'm gonna suggest that it's up your butthole
[02:00.29] "Where's my phone?" "Is it up your butthole?"
[02:02.23] "I lost my loan." "Have you checked up your b-hole?"
[02:04.12] "I'm losing my patience." "Check your anus"
[02:05.97] "Where is your class?" "I think it's stuck up your ass"
[02:07.62] "I just lost my grandma"
[02:09.23] "Oh my god, I'm so sorry"
[02:10.54] Are you capable of not saying she's up my asshole?
[02:12.33] Of course, my condolences
[02:13.69] I'm not looking for a silly joke right now
[02:15.50] Yeah, yeah... what are you looking for?
[02:18.79] Honestly, just like, a shoulder to cr—
[02:22.16] Have you checked your butthole?
[02:23.76] Ski-dap, ba-dap, butthole
[02:26.03] Maybe you'll find your dead grandma up there, too
[02:29.24] Oh, I fuckin' got you, butthole
[02:31.54] My family hate me
[02:32.72] This might be the reason that I've got no close friends
[02:37.37] Fuckin' worth it, baby
